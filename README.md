# Fraunces Font Project
by Spencer Charles

Fraunces is a display, "Old Style" soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as [Windsor](http://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/), Souvenir, and the Cooper Series.

This typeface family is still under development, and will be ready for initial release by Summer 2019.
