Fraunces is a display, "Old Style" soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as [Windsor](http://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/), Souvenir, and the Cooper Series.

This typeface family is still under development, and will be ready for initial release by the end of 2019.

## What can Fraunces do?

The Fraunces font family is composed of a Roman and Italic, and is being built as a Variable Font. Between these two styles, the family spans 3 axes: Optical Size, Weight, and Goofy. 

### Optical Size Axis

The optical size axis ties together changes in contrast, x-height, spacing, and character widths. As the optical size decreases, the x-height increases, spacing opens up, and the characters expand slightly in the width.

Many of the peculiar, wonky characteristics that are suitable for display usage are less desirable for more continuous reading. At certain smaller optical sizes (18px and less), specific characters are substituted for a more normalized character.

In the Roman, the characters that substitute are the h, n, m, and s. In the italic, the b, h, and v are swapped for a more simplified form.

### Weight Axis

The weight axis spans Light to Black. Nuff said.

### Goofy Axis

The Goofy axis gives access to the chocolate-y, chunky forms that are available towards the Optical Min, but still retaining other Optical Sizing considerations, such as change in x-height, spacing, width, and subbing of more unusual characters.
