# Fraunces Production Notes – August 7th – Spencer

## Demonstration of Goofy Axis

The following animated gifs will demonstrate how the Goofy axis behaves across change in OpSz and Wght. 

The Goof Min is essentially the unchanged Optical Max masters that we see currently in the design space. I've incorporated non-linear axis mapping for OpSz in the .designspace file, so that the delicate features are retained for a larger size range.

The Goofy Max decreases the contrast, and slight change in width that we see in the Optical Sizing, however retains the lower x-height, tighter spacing, and long ascenders/descenders.
