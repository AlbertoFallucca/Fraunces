# Fraunces Production Notes – August 2nd – Spencer

## Finished Test Word

This week, Flavia and I finished drawing the test word HAMBURGEFONTSIV in upper and lowercase, for all Roman and Italic masters.

I also spent a good part of the week refining the proof doc scripts to look at spacing strings for each master, character to character comparisons of masters with Beta builds, and longer paragraph settings and 3 optical sizes. 

Flavia is going to go through the proof docs and write down all adjustments and corrections that she thinks need to be made. I will do the same.

After these corrections, I will then interpolate the masters to be used for the Goofy axis. I started testing this idea this afternoon, and I think it's working rather well (proof doc folder 080219). 

## Next Steps

– Incorporate adjustments/corrections from latest proofs
– Build out Goofy axis for testing
