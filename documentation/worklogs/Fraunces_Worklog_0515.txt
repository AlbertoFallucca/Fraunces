# Fraunces Worklog: May 15th

Today, I turned my attention to starting to address spacing problems. I've been very loose with spacing up till now, and I think it's creating unnecessary inconsistencies (especially with similar characters i.e. e o c). So I spent today setting up groups for the Roman & Italic. I'm sure this will come in handy down the road for kerning everything as well.
