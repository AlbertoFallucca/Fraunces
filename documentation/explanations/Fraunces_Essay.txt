Introducing Fraunces,  a new typeface family by Charles&Thorn.

In the early summer of 2018, Google Fonts approached us with the challenge of designing a display typeface. I spent some time perusing the catalog, and was struck by a pretty big hole in the typographic voices available, a hole normally occupied by Cooper Black, Windsor, Souvenir, Clearface, and other “wonky” typefaces made popular in the 1970's.  Of course, many type designers and critics of this style of letterform would see this as a welcome oversight. Matthew Carter memorably had this to say:

“It is one thing to lay out a multi-weight family schematically, it is quite another to draw a workable Ultra Black with personality of its own, a process close to caricature — an exaggeration of normal features to shape forms at once massive and articulate. Without careful design, boldfaces lose definition and look as though they have been dipped in chocolate.”

Yes, there were rounded, soft letters, but there were also higher contrast, elegant forms, such as the faces of Robert DeLittle. To make this typeface would not be simply creating my take on
